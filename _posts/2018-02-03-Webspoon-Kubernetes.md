**Kubernetes** is the rising star when it comes to **container deployment**. In this article we will take a look at how to deploy Pentaho Data Integration's **Webspoon** to the **Google Cloud Platform** using **Kubernetes**.

We can find the **Webspoon Docker Image** [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/hiromuhota/webspoon). Since we want a reproducable deployment, we must not use the `:lastest` tag but a more specific one, e.g. `0.8.0.13-full`. A list of available tags can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/hiromuhota/webspoon/tags/).

**Hiromu** mentions in regards to tags: "`0.8.0-base` does not include spoon.war, please use `0.8.0.13-full` instead. As of today (2018-02-04), latest is the same as `0.8.0.13` and `latest-full` is the same as `0.8.0.13-full`. `latest` and `latest-full` are changing: they always refer to the `latest` released version. `latest` only has spoon.war and `latest-full` includes plugins too. `0.8.0-base` does not include spoon.war because spoon.war is changing and those plugins are not. Under these settings, the next release (`0.8.0.14-full`) is only different (from `0.8.0.13-full`) in spoon.war because they stem from the same `0.8.0-base`. This makes upload/download much smaller."

We will start in a simple fashion by creating a **Deployment** to house our **Webspoon Docker container**. Our first attempt will be to define our environment in a **imperative way** (which is not best practice). Later, we will express our environment in a **declarative** way and save the file to our git repo. Whenever we make changes to this file, we commit it. This way we keep a history of deployments. If you want to use the cutting edge version, please use `nightly-full`. This is based on the very latest commit. Note that I havenâ€™t uploaded nighly because I think most of users use `-full` tags."


If you wish, you can read up on some background info here:

- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine Docs](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/)
- [GCP Kubernetes Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/quickstart)
- [Gloud Command Line Client](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/)
- [kubectl command overview](https://kubernetes-v1-4.github.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/)

To set up a new cluster/environment, we can use the following tools:

- Web UI
- REST API
- command line:
  - [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/)
  - local command line

We will go with the last option.

# Getting Ready

Register with the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) or via [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).

Install the **Cloud SDK** by following one of the [Quickstart Guides](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts).

Here are the commands I ran on **Fedora** (again, pick the right Quickstarter Guide for your OS):

```bash
# Update YUM with Cloud SDK repo information:
sudo tee -a /etc/yum.repos.d/google-cloud-sdk.repo << EOM
[google-cloud-sdk]
name=Google Cloud SDK
baseurl=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/repos/cloud-sdk-el7-x86_64
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/yum-key.gpg
       https://packages.cloud.google.com/yum/doc/rpm-package-key.gpg
EOM

# The indentation for the 2nd line of gpgkey is important.

# Install the Cloud SDK
# gcloud components install kubectl => error, used this instead:
sudo dnf install kubectl
```

## Imperative Approach

This is **not considered best practice**. We will only use this for a quick prototype and then switch to the declarative approach:

```bash
# create project
gcloud projects create kubwebspoon
# OR if project already exist, set project id
gcloud config set project kubwebspoon
# set compute zone
# list of available zones
# https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/#available
gcloud config set compute/zone us-west1-a
```

Next we will create our **Kubernetes cluster**. While the `gcloud container clusters create` command provides defaults for many settings, you might want to define the **machine type** and the **number of nodes**.

You can find info on the GCP **machine types** [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) or alternatively you can run this command:

```
gcloud compute machine-types list
```

Let's create a **cluster** with **3 nodes** and **machine type** `n1-standard-1` :

```bash
# create kubernetes engine cluster
# running command again after enabling API
gcloud container clusters create webspoon-cluster --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --num-nodes=3
```

At this stage I got following error:

```
ERROR: (gcloud.container.clusters.create) ResponseError: code=403, message=The Kubernetes Engine API is not enabled for project kubwebspoon. Please ensure it is enabled in the Google Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/container.googleapis.com/overview?project=kubwebspoon and try again.
```

Open the link shown above in a web browser:

![](/images/webspoon-kubernetes/kubwebspoon-google-kubernetes-engine-api.png)

Click on **Enable**. It will ask you to link this project to a billing account, which you will have to confirm to proceed.

It will take some time for the **Google Kubernetes Engine API** to be enabled.

```bash
# create kubernetes engine cluster
# running command again after enabling API
gcloud container clusters create webspoon-cluster --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --num-nodes=3
```

It will take a few minutes for the **cluster** to **initialise**. 
Once ready, you can also check the cluster details via the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/list?project=kubwebspoon):

![](/images/webspoon-kubernetes/kubwebspoon-cluster-console.png)

Via this page you can retrieve details on the available **nodes** and other useful info. E.g. you can see, that by default 3 nodes got created:

![](/images/webspoon-kubernetes/kubwebspoon-cluster-console-nodes.png)

Next we have to retrieve the **authentication details**:

```bash
# get authentication credentials to interact with cluster
gcloud container clusters get-credentials webspoon-cluster
```

The last command fetches cluster endpoint and auth data and generates a `kubeconfig` entry for our project. This will link our Google Cloud Platform details with the `kubectl` command. In other words, `kubectl` is aware of our deployment environment now.

Let's deploy our **application**:

```bash
# deploy application
kubectl run webspoon-server --image hiromuhota/webspoon:0.8.0.13-full --port 8080 --env="JAVA_OPTS=-Xms1024m -Xmx1920m"
```

> **Note**: If in doubt, one of the best ways to figure out how to define options for the `kubectl run` command is to execute the following:

```bash
kubectl help run
```

> **Note**: To pull an image from **Docker Hub** instead of **Google Cloud Registry**, just specify the standard Google Hub path - nice and easy, no other changes required! (We applied this above, just in case you wonder).

> **Note**: Since we want to create a reproducible state, we pull a specific tag of the image, not `:latest`!

Via the **GCP web console** **Workloads Dashboard** you can see what's going on in your cluster:

- [Docu](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/dashboards?hl=en_GB&_ga=2.118659081.-1277774029.1501918887#workloads)
- [Workloads Dashboard Web UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/workload)

![](/images/webspoon-kubernetes/kubwebspoon-cluster-console-workloads.png)

As expected, there is one `webspoon-server` **pod** running.

You can click on the **Pod name**, which will get you to the **Deployment details** page. Apart from seeing the details, you can also use the **Actions** menu to expose the pod, start auto-scaling, rolling updates etc. The **Kubectl** menu provides options to export the configuration as a YAML file (among other options). If you scroll to the bottom of this page, you'll find the **Managed pods** section. Click on the pod name link and that will get you to the **Pod details** page. A very nice option here is that you can connect to the pod via a web terminal (**Kubectl > Exec > webspoon-server**):

![](/images/webspoon-kubernetes/kubwebspoon-log-on-to-pod.png)

As originally stated, we will **not use the Web UI** for configuration, but **continue on the command line**.

If we were interest in checking if the `JAVA_OPTS` were correctly set within the container, we could log into it like so:

```bash
# list running pods
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
webspoon-server-2240090095-dvkdp   1/1       Running   0          14m
# webspoon-server-2240090095-dvkdp is the PODNAME in this case
# below, replace PODNAME with yours
$ kubectl exec -it [PODNAME] -c webspoon-server -- /bin/bash
root@[PODNAME]:/usr/local/tomcat# env | grep JAVA
JAVA_OPTS=-Xms1024m -Xmx1920m
JAVA_HOME=/docker-java-home/jre
JAVA_VERSION=8u151
CA_CERTIFICATES_JAVA_VERSION=20170531+nmu1
JAVA_DEBIAN_VERSION=8u151-b12-1~deb9u1
```

Let's now add some networking configuration by means of **service** in order to be able to access **Webspoon** from the outside world:

```bash
# expose your app via a service
kubectl expose deployment webspoon-server --type "LoadBalancer"
```

You can inspect details on this **service** via the [Discovery & load balancing dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/kubernetes/discovery?project=kubwebspoon):

![](/images/webspoon-kubernetes/kubwebspoon-cluster-console-networking.png)

There are also options to retrieve details via your local command line:

```bash
# inspect application
kubectl get service webspoon-server
```

Yes, yes, yes, you want to know how to access the actual **WebSpoon UI**:

Get the external IP address:

```bash
kubectl describe services/webspoon-server
```

In the return message look for the IP mentioned next to **LoadBalancer Ingress**.

Then type this into your web browser:

```
http://[LOADBALANCERINGRESSIP]:8080/spoon/spoon
```

![](/images/webspoon-kubernetes/kubwebspoon-exposed-webui.png)


Remember that in the beginning I mentioned that this imperative approach of setting the environment up is not **best practice**? We can get a headstart for the next section, where we will explore the **declarative approach** by downloading the declarative `Deployments` file that got created automatically in the background for us:

```bash
$ kubectl get deployment webspoon-server -o yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: "1"
  creationTimestamp: 2018-02-04T12:18:58Z
  generation: 1
  labels:
    run: webspoon-server
... 
```

The same applies to the **service**:

```yaml
$ kubectl get services/webspoon-server -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: 2018-02-04T17:47:09Z
  labels:
    run: webspoon-server
  name: webspoon-server
... 
```

Finally, we might want to **destroy the environment** to stop incurring charges:

```bash
## destroy app
# destroy service
kubectl delete service webspoon-server
# delete cluster
gcloud container clusters delete webspoon-cluster
```

# Declarative Approach

While the `gcloud container clusters create` command provides defaults for many settings, you might want to define the **machine type** and the **number of nodes**.

You can find info on the GCP **machine types** [here](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) or alternatively you can run this command:

```
gcloud compute machine-types list
```

Let's create a **cluster** with **3 nodes** and **machine type** `n1-standard-1` :

```bash
# create kubernetes engine cluster
# running command again after enabling API
gcloud container clusters create webspoon-cluster --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --num-nodes=3
# get authentication credentials to interact with cluster
gcloud container clusters get-credentials webspoon-cluster
```

Create a file called `webspoon-deployment.yaml`:

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webspoon-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  minReadySeconds: 20
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
        maxUnavailable: 1
        maxSurge: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: webspoon-server
        zone: dev
        version: v1
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webspoon
        image: hiromuhota/webspoon:0.8.0.13-full
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "2Gi"
            cpu: "1"
        env:
          - name: JAVA_OPTS
            value: "-Xms1024m -Xmx1920m"
```

Upload the config file:

```
kubectl apply -f [PATHTOFILE]/webspoon-deployment.yaml
# my version
kubectl apply -f /home/dsteiner/git/diethardsteiner.github.io/sample-files/pdi/webspoon/kubernetes/webspoon-deployment.yaml
```

> **Note**: The `kubectl apply -f` command also accepts a directory as input. This is particular useful when you have more than one configuration file to load (as you can imagine).


Create a file called `webspoon-service.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: webspoon-service
  labels:
    app: webspoon-server
    zone: dev
spec:
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30702
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    run: webspoon-server
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: LoadBalancer
```

In a bit **Webspoon** is available on:

```
http://[LOADBALANCERIP]:8080/spoon/spoon
```

E voila, that's it! We have a **load balanced Webspoon cluster**! Nice and easy. And we get all the benefits: if containers or pods fall over, we automatically get new ones, uprades and rollbacks are easy etc etc.

Note that if you upload new versions of these config files, a revision will be created - so you can always fallback to a previous version if required. You should commit each version of the config file to your git repo.

> **Important**: This setup has no security in place, so whoever gets hold of the IP address can log on. I strongly recommend that you set up security for Webspoon.

Finally, we might want to **destroy the environment** to stop incurring charges:

```bash
## destroy app
# destroy service
kubectl delete service webspoon-server
# delete cluster
gcloud container clusters delete webspoon-cluster
```

In the next blog post we will take a look at how to define a **volume** so that data gets persisted in case a container falls over.
