# Announcing the MDX Maestro Challenge Series

For a while now the idea lingered in me to start a series of MDX challenges! It's time to start this challenge now! I am not an MDX expert myself. I've had my fair share of writing MDX queries, but I am still pretty much trying to improve my knowledge and hence I am always looking forward to some MDX challenges!

So how does **MDX Challenge Series** work?

- **Every 3 weeks** there will be a **new challenge**. I'll start off with a few challenges, but I will invite a few others to post challenges to the group.
- We will be using the **sample cubes** supplied with the **Pentaho BA Server** installation: **SteelWheels > SteelWheelsSales** and **Sample Data > Quadrant Analysis**. If you don't have the BA/BI Server installed, you can download the open source (free) version from [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pentaho/files/Business%20Intelligence%20Server/6.1/)
- Once you have **solved** the challenge, **submit** your MDX query [here](http://diethardsteiner.github.io/contact.html). Please state your full name together with the MDX query.
- For each correct **solution** you can earn 1 point.
- The results will be published here.
- The correct solution for each challenge will be **published** on this blog.
- The winner of the challenge will earn the **MDX Maestro** award! There is no money involve, not even beer, it's all about the learning experience and fun!

# MDX Challenge `#1`

And here we start off with the **first challange**:

**Challenge Description**: 

Using the **SteelWheelsSales** cube, show the **months** February to August 2003 only as well as the **quarter** and **year** for this period on the **rows**, and the **sales** and a calculated measure called **curated sales** on the **columns**.

**Curated Sales** must be only based on the **months** February to August 2003. The totals for quarters and the year must respect this!

The **expected result** should look like this:

**Deadline**: 3rd of June 2016

Enjoy!
