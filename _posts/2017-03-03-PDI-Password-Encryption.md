## Encrypting a password in PDI

For **database connections** as well as various other sensistive accounts **encrypting** the **password** instead of storing it in plain-text within e.g. properties files is advisable. **PDI** ships with a handy **encryption tool** which is very easy to use:

```bash
$ ./encr.sh -kettle '<your-password>'
```

> **Note**: Enclose your password in single quotation mark so any special characters do not get interpreted by the shell.

This command will return the encrypted password.

You get the general usage info by just typing:

```bash
$ ./encr.sh
encr usage:

  encr <-kettle|-carte> <password>
  Options:
    -kettle: generate an obfuscated password to include in Kettle XML files
    -carte : generate an obfuscated password to include in the carte password file 'pwd/kettle.pwd'
```

Example: Encrypting password `test`:

```bash
$ ./encr.sh -kettle test

```

The encrypted password in this case is:

```
Encrypted 2be98afc86aa7f2e4cb79ce10ca97bcce
```

**Note**: Make sure you include `Encrypted ` when specifying the password!

## How to decrypt the password for steps that don't support it natively

Within PDI **Database connections** decrypt passwords natively, however, steps, like e.g. the **HTTP** step, don't dycrypt an encrypted password automatically. The work-around for this is to use a **UDJE** (User Defined Java Expression). 

Create a new field within the UDJE step called `decrypted_password` and add this Java snippet:

```java
import org.pentaho.di.core.encryption.Encr;Encr.decryptPassword(encrypted_password)
```

`encrypted_password` in the code snipped above is an incoming field containing ... well you guessed it.

How could you have found out about this function? 

Just search the **Pentaho Kettle Github repo**:

```
https://github.com/pentaho/pentaho-kettle/search?utf8=âœ“&q=decryptPassword&type=Code
```

The idea is to create a dedicate transformation which uses a **Get Variable** step to get hold of the encrypted password variable, then you can use the **User Defined Java Expression** to decrypt the password and finally use a **JavaScript** step to set the variable:

```javascript
setVariable("VAR_PW_DECRYPTED",decrypted_password,"r");
```

> **Important**: Do not use the **Set Variable** step as it will print out the decrypted password to the log.
